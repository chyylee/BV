# Manuscript Code and Data

Open Example_Usage.m to replicate figures from our manuscript, it requires the files GvLi_ODE_function.m, Sense_1D_Params.m, Sense_1D_ratio.m, surface_data.m, parameters.m, params.mat. All of these files are in the 2_sp_model folder.

Data sets necessary to replicate reults can be found in the Data_sets folder, which has the in vitro co-culture validation in Fig1_figS4_Validation_Data.csv, data used to parameterize the model in figS1_parameterization.txt and figS2_growth.xlsx, and the subset of the clinical data needed to replicate results is in Clinical_Validation_Data.xlsx.

LHS-PRCC models are in the LHS_sampling_models folder, which uses code developed by the Kirschner Group at the University of Michigan (http://malthus.micro.med.umich.edu/lab/usadata/).
